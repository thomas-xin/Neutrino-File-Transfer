# Neutrino-File-Transfer
A multithreaded file transfer program that recursively concatenates a folder of files. Intended for fast transfer of databases with thousands of small files, currently implemented to be uncompressed. Originally designed for [Miza](https://github.com/thomas-xin/Miza)'s database.

## Features
- `python neutrino.py input` will copy the file or folder `input` into a single file named `.output`.
- `python neutrino.py .output` (Note: currently hardcoded to be the string `".output"`) will extract all files in `.output` and place them in a folder named `output`.
- Duplicate files are omitted and instead stored as pointers to their copies.
- The file metadata is stored at the end, and is read in reverse during restoration.
- Relative paths and their indices in the concatenated file are stored at the end of the output file and will be used to restore them.
- The file is terminated by a 0x80-separated little endian number representing the size in bytes of the file path object.
